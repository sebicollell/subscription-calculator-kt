# Problem Summary
The Marketing department is worried that we are paying users with incorrect benefits/credit.

## Business Rules
At Cooltra, there are XXX subscriptions that give you extra benefits/credit depending on how much you use 

* The user states how much wants to pay for the Subscription.
* The subscription payment can be bi-weekly or monthly
* The user selects how many spotlight days associated with her account has
> XXX days are a premium feature that gives you XXX.

Thereâ€™s always a promotion that gets paid monthly. The subscription is the lesser amount of the following:

The total amount of the Silver account
The amount based on the number of Spotlight days the user wants (cap):

Spotlight days | cap
--- | ---
1 | 250
2 | 400
\>2 | 600
